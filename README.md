This is a task given to us on the language C and it's my first prograamme in C. It's only going to contain the fundamentals in C language, so if you're not new to C or already an expert in this subject, you might want to skip but if you're new, want to refresh your memory or want to check if theirr new things you might pick up, please do check the codes. I'll make sure to be detailed in my commit, to tell what each additon does.
